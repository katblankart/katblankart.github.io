Research fields
-------

My research is in the areas of health and innovation. I study the institutional settings of determining value of and access to health technology. An important aspect of this research is how providers and patients use technology to improve health and health care. I am especially dedicated to study the economics and management of pharmaceutical care. I employ the state of the art toolbox to establish causal analyses relying on data science techniques, econometrics, as well as qualitative methods.
