# Health and Human Capital in a Transition Economy – Research agenda for Ukraine - Virtual Workshop

The workshop will take place **completely virtually** on **Wednesday, February 22, 2023**.

The workshop aims to gather (junior) researchers, and practitioners, and policy-makers to promote economic and policy research on Ukraine and other Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, to exchange best practices and lessons learned and formulate policy recommendations to support Ukraine’s transition as EU Candidate. It provides a platform to network, exchange research ideas, and discuss existing scientific work to increase research on Ukraine and other CEE countries and to advance evidence-based policies.  Topics include, but are not limited to, applied economic and policy research in the fields of health, education and labour economics. No prior knowledge of the Ukrainian context required, but a willingness to engage with the country is welcomed.



## Why should you participate in this workshop?

If you have been asking one of the following questions, you should apply to the workshop:

1. Performing or thinking about performing research on problems specific to Ukraine and other Central and Eastern European countries? The workshop aims to establish research capacities on health, labour, and education with a special application to Ukraine. This could include topics like the role of decentralization and institutions, evaluation of major reforms, consequences of internal and external mass migration.
2. Seeking for collaboration? We aim to build a network with (junior) researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers.
3. Aiming to perform policy relevant research in the context of Ukraine? You will learn how to support policy-makers in formulating evidence-based policies to advance Ukraine’s transition as EU candidate.
