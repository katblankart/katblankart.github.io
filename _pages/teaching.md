# Data science techniques in health care research

I have developed a project based seminar in which graduate students perform a data science project and apply econometrics using publicly available health care data based on the [US Medical Expenditures Panel Survey](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/) and the [US National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/index.htm).

This course is part of [Data Campus at University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/ub/datacampus/index.php), an initivative to improve data literacy of students. We develop a resource to perfrom a reproducible research project using health care data for graduate students. Stay tuned!
