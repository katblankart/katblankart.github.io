- [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://scunning.com/mixtape.html), by Scott Cunningham

- [Causal Graphs](http://www.nickchk.com/causalgraphs.html) explained by Nick Huntington Klein helps to gain an intuitive understanding of identifying causal effects from non-experimental data, [more resources provided](http://www.nickchk.com/causalitybook.html)



### Data science in health services and health policy related research

- [Methods Articles Health Care Policy Science Lab](http://healthpolicydatascience.org/methods-seminar)

- [Health Services Research methods corner](https://www.hsr.org/methods-corner-article-collection) provides many resources for program evaluation, econometrics and qualitative research

### (Mostly) openly available health care data

#### Pharmaceutical reference data bases

These data bases help to identify active ingredients by different classifications, all of which are **freely** available.

- [WHO ATC Index](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) helps to find active pharmaceutical ingredients by the ATC classification

- [German ATC Index](https://www.dimdi.de/dynamic/en/drugs/atc-classification/index.html)

- [Drugbank.com](https://www.drugbank.com/) allows finding and classifying drugs by a large variety of criteria including the ATC classification, marketing authorization data for the United States (FDA), Canada and the European Union (EMA), a public use file is available for download if you register your research project.

- [DrugCentral](https://drugcentral.org/download) provides comprehensive data about chemical and pharmacological features of pharmaceuticals as well as marketing authorization data.

- [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) is the US National Library's compedium linking different vocabularies that document drugs. You may browse it via [RxNav](https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/)

- [Swiss Pharmaceutical Reference Database - Spezialitätenliste](https://spezialitätenliste.ch/), is freely available for download

- German pharmaceutical reference databases are behind paywalls, or for scientific research use that requires registration of a research project

	- [WIDO GKV Arzneimittelindex / German Drug Index](https://www.gbe-bund.de/gbe/ergebnisse.prc_tab?fid=8325&suchstring=arzneiverordnungsreport&query_id=&sprache=E&fund_typ=DQM&methode=&vt=&verwandte=1&page_ret=0&seite=1&p_sprachkz=E&p_uid=&p_lfd_nr=&p_news=&p_aid=&hlp_nr=&p_janein=)

- Early assessments of health benefit based on AMNOG ([Arzneimittelmarktneuordnungsgesetz](https://www.g-ba.de/bewertungsverfahren/nutzenbewertung/)) in Germany

    - Comprehensive data of benefit assessments is [provided in XML format from GBA](https://www.g-ba.de/themen/arzneimittel/arzneimittel-richtlinie-anlagen/nutzenbewertung-35a/ais/), currently includes decisions starting from 2020, but will be updated steadily to cover all assessments starting from 2011.
	- [As part of a project funded by the German Research Foundation, I provide data from the first years that AMNOG was in effect](https://www.hcm.wiwi.uni-due.de/en/research-projects/early-benefit-assessment-of-innovative-pharmaceuticals-according-to-amnog-in-germany-empirical-analysis-of-the-decision-making-process/)
	- [DAK AMNOG Report 2020](https://www.dak.de/dak/bundesthemen/dak-amnog-report-2020-2331046.html#/), annual report of AMNOG decisions

## Working Agile and using scrum principles in academic research projects

I am an advocate of agile methods to structure research projects and team work in academia, here are some resources to start off your scrum-based or agile work:

- What is scrum and agile and how can this help to organize scientific work? This [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02620-6) provides an introduction to scrum principles and how the work of research teams could benefit from scrum methods. It introduces key concepts of scrum.

- [The Agile Academic Podcast] and [Agile Academic Blog](https://agilefaculty.wordpress.com/blog/) by Rebecca Pope-Ruark who also has written a book about [agile faculty](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo26106581.html)

- [Some tips about overcommitment by Amy J. Kho](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/managing-overcommitment-in-academia-8d281a2df09)

- Besides scrum, the Pomodoro technique helps to structure a day and [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/) is a tool to do so.
